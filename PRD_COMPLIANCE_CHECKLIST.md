## 📝 Notes for Epic 2 (Chatbot)

When implementing the chatbot:
1. Chatbot can query products by `owner_id` using the Facebook Page ID
2. Search logic from Showcase.tsx can be reused for chatbot queries
3. Product detail URLs are in format: `/:subdomain/product/:id`
4. All product data (title, price, image_url) is available for "Full Showcase" responses

**Database Integration Point:** The `products` table with "Anyone can view products" RLS policy is ready for chatbot queries.
